# BetaTalk
## A real-time chat app made with firebase Firestore and React
### Project gist
Got tired of the Purple library and the whole screenshotting anonymous messages Wahala and as a computer science student I decided to create a better solution ```Betatalk``` (kindly fashi the name please😂)
### BetaTalk makes it very easy for multiple users to communicate in a simulated room (can we call it that😅) and everyone gets to see all messages in realtime, users also have a variety of choices of choices and interfaces to choose from. 
## Conclusion
Tis been very fun working on this lately leave a 🌟 fam😉.

## Project tools
* Firestore database - for storing user messages and rooms
* React - cos y not, React's the best 
* Framer motion - Nobody wants to view a boring app without some spicy animations
* Tailwind - my number one ogee tool, why write extra css when you've got this guy
* Local storage - can't forget this one, this project makes use of a lot of local storage at the backend (not literal backend abeg don't bite me😏) to store user choices and Dem other stuffs
